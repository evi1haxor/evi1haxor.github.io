# Mosquiteer's Gambit

Having my room just beside the garden, I evoked my hatred toward these little sanguivorous flies. Just when India is struggling with a global pandemic, the yearly malaria crisis may come on the doorstep any time now. Although the government does what it has to, but I ask, is it the best we can do? Every year, literally waiting for it to hit us? One way, also proposed in the literature, is to kill all the mosquitoes. But I believe as far as vector-borne diseases are concerned, vanishing off a complete species just because they steal your blood is not worth the risk that the ecosystem has to suffer because of this action. So what if we could selectively kill those mosquitoes which are infected by the pathogen- The vectors. While it can be replicated for all the vector-borne diseases, my idea takes mosquitoes as the model vector. It puts a framework to engineer a tool that can automate the task of selectively killing the infected vectors and, once sterilized, to convert them into 100% natural and biodegradable chemical test kit....
