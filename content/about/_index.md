Hi! I am **Archit**, currently a junior year undergraduate student at **IIT Jodhpur** in the department of **Bioscience and Bioengineering**. I am a highly dedicated and hard-working individual seeking an entry-level position to begin my career in a high-level professional environment. By definition, what I want to do in life is called entrepreneurship (as in, doing my own thing). But don't let the wordings fool you. *My goals are beyond your understanding*, so to speak. 

I am a firm believer and practitioner of [the first principle of thinking](https://jamesclear.com/first-principles). I percieve the world in accordance of its function rather than its form. This mindset helps me to have a clear understanding of the things which, I believes, is a great step in the direction of the ideology of [learning for mastery](https://www.ted.com/talks/sal_khan_let_s_teach_for_mastery_not_test_scores?language=en). 

On best days, you’ll catch me reading books, research papers, listening to podcasts, tweeting, pushing pixels or petting some or the other of my pet projects. I can also be found walking/cycling distances while in *estado-de-resonancia* with the melodies of **Louis The Child** and **Glass Animals** or the trip-hop numbers of **Lucian**.

## Research Interests
I have more than a semester long experience of working in Computational Biology lab at IIT Jodhpur where I have worked on algorithms for cancer subtype discovery from multimodal omic data. Mainly my work involved investigation and development of multimodal data integration algorithms, multimodal data clustering algorithms and dimensionality reduction algorithms. In addition to that, I love to craft beautiful and clever visualisations that illustrate astounding results. <br> I have always been fascinated by how some mathematical caoncept applied just right can reveal so much insight about a data.  The biological implications that my work has in the development of personalised cancer therapuetics beckons me to stick with this amazing universe of applied mathematics and computaional biology.

## Random Facts
- *Archit*, as I am, is an ancient word of *Sanskrit* origin (अर्चित) and form *'Arcita'* which literally means *worshipped/praised/respected*. 
- In my opinion, my whole life is a [bandit problem](https://joshkaufman.net/explore-exploit/).
- I hangout on twitter.
- Big time TBBT fan!
- I drink a lot of coffee.
- My hobby: Imagining people speaking in someone else's voice.
