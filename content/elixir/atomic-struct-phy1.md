# Evolution of the Atomic Structure
The idea of the elements and atoms is not new. The thought encompasses it's foundation, back from over 2.5 millennia! <Img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evi1haxor/e1ixir/master/static/Screenshot_2018-10-12-23-58-57-142_com.android.chrome.png" align = "left" height= 260px /> _Democritus:_ One of the greatest philosopher mankind has ever had. His theory argues the indivisibility of atom. In his theory, he claimed that there must exist different kinds of atom, with different masses and sizes. These different kinds of atom, then constitute observable objects. However, he added, the characteristics like taste, colour and feel of touch emanates from the different ways the atoms might arrange in. Fundamentally, his philosophy scratches the surface of modern idea of chemical bonding and characteristics of the atom, pretty well.
For others the thought was so ahead of time that they laughed at him. Though, early Greek philosophers used to propose their ideas just by thought processing and logic, and not by experiments. And that's why it's said for Greek philosophers: __"All thoughts and no action!"__ So most of the time, they had ideas, they had plans, but they just don't want to toil for justifying it through real life experiences.

Next when the topic caught the heat was during 1800s with Dalton's intelligent findings. A few ethos from Dalton's early Modern atomic theory are-

‌
* All matter is composed of extremely small particles called atoms.

* Atoms of a given element are identical in size, mass, and other properties while atoms of different elements differ in size, mass, and other properties.

* Atoms cannot be subdivided, created, or destroyed.

* Atoms of different elements can combine in simple whole number ratios to form chemical compounds.

* In chemical reactions, atoms are combined, separated, or rearranged.

You'd probably been taught the dossiers on this in school. So I won't take trouble to explain them again here unnecessarily.

_Science is the study of conclusions._ All the theories must be driven by logical arguments derived from well designed experiments. Superfluously mentioning,that these theories are susceptible to refinement (if needed) with subsequent experiments. And that's the best thing about the Science culture. All of the little idea about _the atom_ that we have today is solely based on experiments and observations.
 For such a small of an atom, many experiments were performed. Thence, proposing numerous _models_ of the atomic structure. But wait....why the _models_..? Well, you see, (oh! Actually you can't see...that's the real problem) our eyes can detect minimum size of 400nm (lower limit of λ of the visible region of the spectrum). So, human can't see the atoms unsupported, which is as small as of the order 3 × 10<sup>-7</sup> m. That's why there are _models_ of the structure of an atom, 'cause that _model_ tag give it an uncertainty in correctness.

 So, typed some important experiments herein, which had put the foundation of our modern perception of atomic theory.

## A Few Laboratory Affairs

### Electrical Nature

> "I have such conviction that the power which governs electrodecomposition and ordinary chemical attractions is the same."

That was Faraday been quoted, back from 1833 when he proposed a quite pensive conclusions from his investigations of electrolysis, which not only gave a slight clue of electrical nature of matter, but also, strongly argued the law of chemical combination, which furthermore say a lot about existence of atoms(his second statement as mentioned below)

#### Faraday's Law of electrodecomposition:

1. A given amount of electricity will always deposit the same weight of a given material at an electrode.
2. The weight of various materials deposited, evolved, or dissolved at an electrode by a fixed amount of electricity are proportional to the equivalent weight of these substances.

Considering the first law, we can say, if a fixed amount of electricity influences (oxidise or reduce) a fixed number of atoms, then electricity itself must have its constituting particles. Thereby, in 1874, the word _electron_ was proposed by *G.J. Stoney*, for those **hypothetical** fundamental electrical particles. Hypothetical because, still there wasn't any proofs of experiments for their existence. It took whopping 23 years, that is 1897, when a strong evidence claiming the existence of electrons came up.

#### Cathode ray experiment

The experiment was intended to study the conducting property of gases at low pressure. Gases are electrically insulators in ordinary conditions, they, however, _break down_ and start conducting, if subjected to high voltage metal electrodes, with light emission as a signature of the episode. During other subsequent experiments, experimentalists tried to tinker around. So they induced a small fan like structure inside the tube just to see, as usual. When they applied the voltage across the terminals, they found the fan like structure rotating! This clearly showed that what they were calling the _Ray_ (like Cathode RAY) are actually particles, heavy enough to transcend their momentum to the wings of the fan. The thing that misguided them to believe that those were rays was that when they put an opaque object in the path of those rays, it made shadow impression  on the opposite wall of cathode. It's not like photons don't pass on their momentum, it's just that it doesn't suffice the fan to move. Then, however, noone took the pain to modify the name.

You can further read about discovery of electron, proton and neutron [here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subatomic_particle). It is the least of what I've got for you here (wait for QED!). Although, I would like to take the courtesy to write a separate post dedicated to Nucleus.


#### Millican's Oil Drop Experiment

_Millican_ was an American physicist who was awarded Noble Prize in Physics in 1923 for his work in Particle Physics(mainly elementary electronic charge) and photoelectric effect.<br>
<Img src = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evi1haxor/e1ixir/master/static/IMG_20180928_012116.jpg" align= "right" height=200px/>
**A Little more about Robert A. Millican:** Millican had had a share of contribution in photoelectric effect. This unusual phenomenon- photoelectric effect, was first discovered by a German physicist Heinrich Rudolf Hertz in 1887. The hottest reason why it caught moot among the physics community of that time was that this phenomenon cannot be explained by classical physics, which takes light as electromagnetic wave. As classical physics suggest that kinetic energy of ejected electron must increase on increasing the intensity, but here, results depicts a whole set of data results, that it doesn't even depend on intensity. It varies linearly with frequency instead. Like- <br> ![Einstein's photoelectric equation for kinetic energy of ejected electron](http://mathurl.com/yb6l94f9.png)<br>

 Another incomprehensible observation that they got was that there was virtually no time lag between irradiation and electron emission.<br>
This perplexing behaviour of light-matter interaction led Albert Einstein to formulate photon hypothesis in 1905. He, in his theory tried to pursued us to _believe_ in a very `uncommonsensy` thought, that light is made of particles. Well, what to say...it's his way of dealing with stuff. He named them _Photons_. He stated that each photons carries a specific amount of energy, given by <br> ![E=h\nu](http://mathurl.com/celhkrc.png) <br>


> That equation! That damn equation! It has got a story of its own. Will write about it too someday.<br>


Millican carefully examined the results and verified Einstein's equation to high precision which apparently got him a Nobel prize!

Anyways, going with the Oil drop experiment (1909) by Millican and Fletcher- An intelligent setup that was designed to measure the elementary charge on the electron utilising the tools from classical physics only. <IMG src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evi1haxor/e1ixir/master/static/Screenshot_2018-09-28-00-36-00-310_com.android.chrome.png" align="left" height=300px/>

The arrangement consist of a spray bottle (atomiser) which sprays the oil contained in it, in fine and consistently small sized droplets.
<IMG src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evi1haxor/e1ixir/c1b6c952370b12b646e151bb516a4fac828ca716/static/IMG_20180928_012042.jpg" align="right" height=200px /> These droplets then enters a room of two compartments stacked one over the other. The lower compartment has uniform electric field which can be varied through external systems. Lower compartment is irradiated with X-Rays in order to ionise the oil drop, so now they move upward under the influence of electric field.
<br>
So now if I do some math with <br>

* Terminal velocity of oil drop in upper compartment  ![v1](http://mathurl.com/ybzsz5rg.png) <br>
* Mass of the drop ![m](http://mathurl.com/yd79waz.png) <br>
* Accelaratiomn due to garvity ![g](http://mathurl.com/6c8lfp3.png) <br>
* Coefficient of viscosity ![eta](http://mathurl.com/77bhz7l.png) <br>
* Radius ![r](http://mathurl.com/375ggas.png) <br>
<br>
According to Stoke's theorem
![differential in v1](http://mathurl.com/yb2ghkyo.png) <br>
![solving differential](http://mathurl.com/y7eolurw.png) <br>
![integrating](http://mathurl.com/yanjoccn.png) <br>
If I assume that its initial vertical velocity was 0, then- <br>
![Solved](http://mathurl.com/ybmm4sx4.png) <br> <br>
Here it can clearly be analyzed that as time tends to infinity, velocity tends to a limiting value of <br>
![terminal velocity](http://mathurl.com/yclq5rdj.png) <br>
Now in a condition where electric field is acting over the suspended oil drop with charge `q`, radius `r` and mass `m`, the terminal velocity expression will ultimately get deduced to <br>
![terminal velocity2](http://mathurl.com/yae68zmd.png) <br>
Since _E_, `m`, `r` and <i>v<sub>t</sub></i> are known or measurable, hence `q` can be  calculated. And it turns out that `q` is always an integral multiple of _1.6 x 10<sup>-19</sup>_. This shows that charge is quantized with a unit value of _1.6 x 10<sup>-19</sup>_ C.

## Quantum Leap

There is a lot to deliver. Although I try to keep it less rigorous in terms of involved mathematics as far as possible, but it would not be good from my side if I leave the fundamental level of mathematical playout around the concept. So, I have decided to take a quantum leap from the stuff which has got overmuch mathematical analysis. I will write a separate post and cite it here as soon as I'm done with it.

Now, buckle yourself up for the most awaited section of this post (as I'm writing it on my editor, unpublished)... `QED`

# Evolution of revolution- QED
In physics, it's a common question about unification of different theories. Afterall, it makes the analysis easier. Otherwise, there would have been plentiful explanation even for a simple observation or experiment. For eliminating inappropriate or cumbersome theories and arguments, there are some tools philosophy serves with; what they call, *the razors* (My personal favourite is Newton's flaming laser sword!). They all have their own technicalities, but the basis is simple- what sounds easier, and have more arguments should be considered over the one which has got fewer assertions.

For example, previously, motion, sound, gravitation, heat, light and optics all were dealt with different theories and reasoning. But no sooner than when Newton came up with the Laws of motion, motion, heat and sound were firstly explained under a single theory. With Newton's breakthrough of these governing laws, the results apparantly explained well the phenomenon of sound and heat. Then we were left with the laws of motion, phenomenon of light and optics, and phenomenon of gravitation. (The theory of gravitation still stands isolated!). Later phenomenon of magnetism and electricity were explained under a simplified theory- electromagnetism (Blame: Sir, James Clerk Maxwell), which proposes that light is an electromagnetic wave.

When theory was developed about the matter, they didn't happen to get the idea using simple classical model down on electrons. They encountered a significant disparity between the experiments and calculations. Meanwhile, evolution of the structure of an atom was onto Schrödinger's equation(uncorrected). But Schrödinger's work wasn't much reliable for complex structures until Paul Dirac made some modifications in the equation using results of theory of relativity. And guess what he got!?! The intrinsic angular momentum of electron as an additional quantum number with other 3. He claimed that electrons are like tiny magnets in themselves (tho these analogies has nothing to do with real life perception..they are *intrinsic*). And the correction made not only tally with the behaviour of electrons in an atom, but in multi-nuclear molecules too- Using Lenear combination of atomic orbitals and [Oppenheimer approximation](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Born–Oppenheimer_approximation).

# QED
**Q E D**! The *Quantum Realm of electronic interaction*!
It wasn't an easy task to calculate stuff at quantum level. The problem of the calculation in QED was straightened out by three Nobel prize winners, 1965- Feynman, Schwinger, Tomonaga. They, along with associated apprentices, developed the most veracious and crisp theory till date the mankind have ever made. Just for sake of giving an idea, Feynman says- *"If you were to measure the distance from Los Angeles to New York to this accuracy, it would be exact to the thickness of a human hair.  That's how delicately Quantum electrodynamics has in the past 50 years being checked- both theoretically and experimentally"*

Then he adds..

> I would like to again impress you with the vast range of phenomena that theory of quantum electrodynamics describes: It's easy to say it backwards: The theory describe all the phenomena of the physical world except the gravitation effect, the thing that holds you in your seat (actually that's a combination of gravity and politeness, I think) and radioactive phenomena which involves nuclei shifting in their energy levels. So if we leave out gravity and radioactivity (more properly, nuclear physics) what have we got left? Gasoline burning in automobiles, forms and bubbles hardness of salt or copper, the stiffness of Steel. In fact biologist are trying to interpret as much as they can about life in terms of Chemistry and as I already explained that theory behind chemistry is quantum electrodynamics.

## Feynman's Approach
The theory is a skilful attempt of showing the nature and behaviour of electrons at the quantum scale, into a clever arrangement of mathematical terms. Most of the time people don't see the significance of that mathematics until shown the [Feynman's diagram](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feynman_diagram). Feynman diagram is an interactive way to put the behaviour of subatomic particles in a simple caricature. Every diagram represents an equation.

If we take a simple experiment of scattering of two electrons..

![Scattering of electrons](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evi1haxor/evi1haxor.github.io/master/images/IMG_20180101_140803_912.jpg)

--You're expected to know about the [Exchange force and Exchange Particles](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exchange_force)--


Even in such a simple experiment there can be infinite possibilities for the way gluon exchange occur within the quantum field. Some of the important possibilities are..

![Possible ways the gluon exchange take place](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evi1haxor/evi1haxor.github.io/master/images/IMG_20180101_125527_182.jpg)

*Each dot pair connection represents one photon transfer*

Though this process of transfer of photons is painstaking. This makes it easier to perceive the maximum probability contributor among all. All we need to do is count the number of dots, lesser the dots, more is the probability amplitude ("Probability amplitude?" You ask; Well, if you've read the Schrödinger's wave equation, you might have encountered with the complex numbers written in bra-ket notation like `<Φ|Ψ>`..here, the bra-ket i.e. left and right, represents the probability amplitude. Squaring the modulus of these complex numbers gives the probability of occurrence of `Φ` event or `Ψ` event)

Most the time QED turns into hardcore mathematical analysis. It takes physics students itself to comprehend it completely in years! At this he said..

> "So now you know what I’m going to talk about. The next question is, will you understand what I’m going to tell you? Everybody who comes to a scientific lecture knows they are not going to understand it, but maybe the lecturer has a nice, colored tie to look at. Not in this case! (Feynman is not wearing a tie.)
> What I am going to tell you about is what we teach our physics students in the third or fourth year of graduate school—and you think I’m going to explain it to you so you can understand it? No, you’re not going to be able to understand it. Why, then, am I going to bother you with all this? Why are you going to sit here all this time, when you won’t be able to understand what I am going to say? It is my task to convince you not to turn away because you don’t understand it. You see, my physics students don’t understand it either. That is because I don’t understand it. Nobody does."

Feynman always has some captivating version of even the boring ideas!
