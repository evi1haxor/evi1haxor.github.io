# Environmental Biotechnology Strategies for Planetary Colonisation

![To Mars and Back](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/evi1haxor/evi1haxor.github.io/master/static/OccMars/TMaB.png)
Past ten years have witnessed some of the best innovations in space technology. It has everything that industry requires to reap- novel technology, business model, service design. With its disruptive [reusable two-side booster technology](https://www.popularmechanics.com/space/rockets/a16640150/falcon-heavy-launches-most-powerful-rocket-world/), SpaceX is on its peak, only to get better with time. Decreasing costs of the launch over the years ratifies the smart engineering techniques that are being executed in the development of new space vehicles and launchers. SpaceX is already working on making space travel affordable, and NASA is planning to launch [humans on a one-way mission to Mars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_mission_to_Mars) by 2030. With all these missions, the space industry has a lot to prove in the coming years.

Amidst all this, the concept of terraformation has also been reverberating a lot these days. Terraformation essentially refers to the geoengineering of the planet to make it habitable for plants and humans. Missions like terraformation require a highly interdisciplinary research effort by engineers and scholars from all around the world. In this work, however, an attempt has been made to subsume environmental biotechnology and bioremediation strategies for the task. With reference to that, this study identifies three challenges regarding planetary terraformation and space exploration odyssey and puts forth the hypotheses adjudicating them with environmental biotechnology strategies.
