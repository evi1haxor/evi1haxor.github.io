      <description>Environmental Biotechnology Strategies for Planetary Colonisation Past ten years have witnessed some of the best innovations in space technology. It has everything that industry requires to reap- novel technology, business model, service design. With its disruptive reusable two-side booster technology, SpaceX is on its peak, only to get better with time. Decreasing costs of the launch over the years ratifies the smart engineering techniques that are being executed in the development of new space vehicles and launchers.</description>

In the modern economy, where at every step one has to face cut-throat competition, it is becoming increasingly important to produce at an elite level.

      <description>Cancer Subtype Discovery from Multi-modal Omic Data Needless to state how bad a disease cancer is. As per WHO, cancer is the second-largest non-infectious reason for the death by natural cause in humans. The earliest cancer research dates back to the 1700s. So it has been around for a very long time, but there is no promising cure for this disease yet. We have found the cure of so many diseases.</description>

      <description>Because services that have setu in their names are rad&amp;rsquo; cool.
Github/CoVup repository 1 2 3 4 5 6 7  ├── meta.json ├── README.md ├── scripts │ ├── main.py └── templates ├── announce.txt └── subscribers.txt   I have made such arrangements (using WayScript) that the script scripts/main.py would trigger itself off every day and send an email to all the subscribers regarding the latest CoV pandemic stats about their district (like active cases, confirmed cases, recovered cases and deceased cases).</description>
